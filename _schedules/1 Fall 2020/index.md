# Python for Data Processing

## Syllabus<br><small>Fall 2020</small>

Welcome to this programming course! In the weeks ahead, you'll use the Python
programming language while learning to solve scientific problems from several
fields of science. This course is intended for students who have no experience
in programming at all. It comprises seven modules, wherein you learn about the
Python language, but foremost about strategies you can use to solve complex
computational problems.

## Staff

Tim Doolan (coordinator)

Simon Pauw (teacher)  

Wouter Vrielink (teacher)

Kiki van Rongen (TA)

You can reach us at <minorai@mprog.nl> for any practical matters or other
questions.

## Getting started

1. Read more of the syllabus, below.
2. [Install](/python/en/installing) Python.

## Deadlines

All assignments in a module should be handed in by *Friday 23:59*.

If you think you will not make a deadline, send us an email *before* the
deadline has expired, so we can try to find a suitable solution.

## Asking questions

If you have any question about the material, there are several ways to get
assistance.

### Ed Q&A Forum

The first place you should try and ask your question is on the Ed
[Ed forum](https://us.edstem.org/courses/2334/). Details on using *Ed* can be
found in the Welcome post there. 

### Videocall on Discord

If you have a very specific question, something that would require sharing
a large portion of your solution, or you are unsure how exactly to phrase your
question for Ed, you can request a videocall with the staff. You can do so on
Discord, using the *QuestionQueue* bot.

The question queue will be open **every weekday from 9:00 to 13:00**. If you
send the *QuestionQueue* bot a direction message starting with `!ask` and then
followed by your question, you will be added to the queue. The staff will take
videocalls from the queue in the order they are asked, and you will be notified
by the *QuestionQueue* bot when it is your turn.

### Werkcollege at Science Park

Once a week there will also be a werkcollege at Science Park, which will
replace the Discord video calls for that day. You can sit there, bring your
laptop to work, meet your fellow students, and ask the staff questions. The
schedule for the werkcolleges can be found on [Datanose](https://datanose.nl/#course[90802]).

### Zoom meetings

There will be Zoom meetings scheduled twice a week, once on **Wednesday at
15:00** and once on **Friday at 15:00**. These meetings will be used to discuss
progress and answer questions. In addition, these meetings may also be used to
give lectures, when there are parts of the theory that require more
explanation. You can also request a topic be discussed in more depth at these
meetings, which then may be covered at the next meeting.

### Email the staff

If you have personal matters to discuss or other questions that do not fit any
of the formats above, you can email the course staff at <minorai@mprog.nl> 

## Passing the course

Your grade for this course will consist of several elements:

### Modules 1 & 2

Module 1 and Module 2 of this course will be graded on a pass/fail basis. If
you receive a failing grade for one of these modules, you will have to
improve your code and submit the assignment again. You must receive a pass
grade for both assignments in order to pass the course. There are 2 main
reasons for this:

1. The material in the first two modules is fundamental. It is important you
are able to solve these assignments sufficiently before moving on to the next
modules.

2. Grading of the later modules will be done mostly on *style* and *design* of
your code. For the first two modules you will still be learning what those
concepts are.

When you've completed the module sufficiently, you will also get feedback on
the style and design of your solution. This should help you improve these
aspects of your code before you are actually graded on them.

### Modules 3 - 7

These modules will each be graded on a 1 to 10 scale. Your grade will mainly
depend on the style and design of your code. These concepts will be further
introduced as you go through the modules, but here are a quick definitions to
give you an idea

Design

: This is about adding effective abstractions to your code. Simple examples
might be to use a loop instead of copy-pasting code, or writing a function for
code you want to reuse several times.

Style

: This is about how readable your code is for other people. For example, using
clear variable names, adding comments and adding whitespace to separate blocks
of code, all can help with the readability.

If you've completed the entire module and your code produces the correct
output, your grade starts at 6. The remainder of your grade is then
determined as follows:

* 0 - Style and design of the code are of insufficient quality. Code does produce correct output and open questions have been answered.

* 1 - Style and design have had some attention, but there are still clear improvements to be made. Answers to any open questions are mostly correct.

* 2 - Style and design are of sufficient quality, answers to open questions are correct.

* 3 - Style and design are very good, answers are correct and show understanding.

* 4 - Exceptional style and design, answers are beyond expectations.

### Exam

Once you've completed all 7 modules there will be an oral exam. This exam will
be scheduled individually with the course staff and will also be *pass/fail*.

Once you've passed the exam, your final grade will be computed as the average
of all your grades for modules 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.

## Goals

This the first few modules are a beginner's course. We will teach you the
basics of Python programming as well as several different ways of solving
computational problems. After this course, we envision that you:

- can transform the description of a simple algorithm into working code by combining basic program elements
- can apply several scientific programming techniques from different areas of study
- can use a couple of libraries in your program and know how to find and read documentation on other libraries
- can make your programs simpler and easier to read by employing a few standard tactics
- can trace and fix several common programming errors

Starting from module 5, we'll introduce more some more advanced concepts. After
which should be able to:

- can use native python data structures (like sets, dictionaries, and tuples)
- analyze the complexity of an algorithm
- quickly learn to use new python packages and know how to find documentation
  for them
- create your own packages
- write proper documentation
- use higher level functional programming concepts (such as map, reduce and filter)
- import and analyze data
- create advanced plots

## Books

No books are required for this course. Embedded in some of the modules are parts of the book *Think Python* by Allen Downey. If you'd like, you can read the remainder of the book on [its website](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/).

## Doing your own work {#academic_honesty}

This course's philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy's other constraints. Collaboration on the course's test and quiz is not permitted at all.

Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in writing from the course's heads. Acts considered not reasonable by the course are handled harshly.

### Reasonable

- Communicating with classmates about problem sets' problems in English (or some other spoken language).

- Discussing the course's material with others in order to understand it better.

- Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code at office hours, elsewhere, or even online, as by viewing, compiling, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.

- Incorporating a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those lines are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the lines' origins.

- Reviewing past semesters' quizzes and solutions thereto.

- Sending or showing code that you've written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.

- Sharing a few lines of your own code online so that others might help you identify and fix a bug.

- Turning to the course's heads for help or receiving help from the course's heads during the quiz or test.

- Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problem set's problems or your own final project.

- Whiteboarding solutions to problem sets with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.

- Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

### Not Reasonable

- Accessing a solution to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.

- Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem set's problem before (re-)submitting your own.

- Decompiling, de-obfuscating, or disassembling the staff's solutions to problem sets.

- Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy's other constraints.

- Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to a problem set's problem when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.

- Looking at another individual's work during the test or quiz.

- Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.

- Providing or making available solutions to problem sets to individuals who might take this course in the future.

- Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problem sets online or elsewhere.

- Splitting a problem set's workload with another individual and combining your work.

- Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond the few lines allowed herein.

- Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.

- Submitting work to this course that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) without prior approval from the course's heads.

- Turning to humans (besides the course's heads) for help or receiving help from humans (besides the course's heads) during the quiz or test.

- Viewing another's solution to a problem set's problem and basing your own solution on it.
