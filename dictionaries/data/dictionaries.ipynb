    "# Dictionaries\n",

    "This will be a very short introduction on a new data structure, called a dictionary. A dictionary, like a list, can be used to store multiple elements together. The main difference with a list is how you access and modify these elements. There are quite a few other important differences, but we'll get into those when we cover dictionaries in detail in a few weeks. The goal here is just to introduce the absolute basics, so you know how to use dictionary in the upcoming machine learning notebooks.\n",

    "* Dictionaries are created using `{}` curly brackets instead of `[]` square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* List are indexed based on the *place an element is the list*, while dictionaries use a **key** to insert or find back elements. When you insert an element with a specific key, you can use that same key to retrieve the element later. A key does not have to be a number, like the list index, but can also be a **string**, allowing you to use *words* as the keys.\n",

    "\n",
    "One important thing to remember though, is that the syntax `dictionary[key] = value` can be used both to add elements to the dictionary and to modify them. If a key is not yet present in the dictionary, like in the examples above, then the new key and value will just be added to the dictionary. If, however, the key was already present in the dictionary, the old value will be *replaced* with the new value. This means there can never be two copies of the same key in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful bit of syntax we'll introduce here, is the `in` operator, which can be used to check whether a *key* is present in a dictionary. As the example above shows, you will get a *KeyError* when trying to retrieve a key that doesn't occur in the dictionary, and so first checking whether the key exists in the dictionary can prevent these type of errors.\n"
